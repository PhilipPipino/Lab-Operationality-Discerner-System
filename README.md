LODS (Lab Operationality Discerner System)
Helps identify if a computer unit in the computer lab room of our univerisity is functional, has a malfunction or is missing.

In this exponentially evolving digital era students and teachers live through, 
computer laboratory rooms have become indispensable assets within educational institutions. 
These spaces serve as hubs for fostering knowledge and granting students access to resources 
for computing and information. Nonetheless, the task of efficiently managing student 
attendance and ensuring the optimal functioning of hardware components within these computer lab 
rooms can present significant challenges. This thesis presents a solution to overcome some of 
these challenges by developing a C++ system for monitoring attendance and hardware status in the 
College of Computing and Information Sciences laboratory rooms.
